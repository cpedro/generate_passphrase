Generate Passphrase
===================

Standalone C program that generates random passphrases of lengths given from 
command line arguments.

This code uses the Diceware 8K word list in C, downloaded from 
http://world.std.com/%7Ereinhold/diceware.html

Random numbers are generated using `random()`, and `srandomdev()` is used to
initialise the state, which *should* be good enough for cryptographic use.

Compiling and running
---------------------
```
$ gcc diceware8k.c generate_passphrase.c -o genpass
```

A single pass phrase can be generated by passing the number of words to use as
an integer as a command line parameter (Must be >= 4).  Since this is a pass
phrase, the words will be seperated by a space.  For applications that allow
spaces, you can use as-is or remove the spaces if needed.

```
$ ./genpass 4
oily sequin yawn menlo
```

Multiple pass phrases can be generated simply by adding more integers as command
line parameters.  Each pass phrase generated will have the number of words
specified.  Each pass phrase will be on different line in the order given.

```
$ ./genpass 4 5 6 7
l6 bobbin basel nora
limb kiva lana 71st goo
rid africa al key chopin korea
fake prong oh toad grail 4k usury
```
